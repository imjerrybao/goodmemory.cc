The IoT Toolkit is an Open Source project to develop a set of tools for building multi-protocol Internet of Things Gateways and Service gateways that enable horizontal co-operation between multiple different protocols and cloud services. The project consists of the Smart Object API, gateway service, and related tools:

&nbsp;

  * Smart Object API gateway service reference implementation
  * HTTP-to-CoAP Semantic mapping proxy
  * Gateway-as-a-Service deployment
  * Application framework, embedded software Agents
  * Semantic discovery and linkage, Linked Data compatibility
  * Tools for multiple sensor net clients
  * Raspberry Pi and cloud micro-instance deployment images (Ubuntu)
  * <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ciseco/eve-alpha-raspberry-pi-wireless-development-hardwa" target="_blank">Ciseco EVE</a> + Raspberry Pi hardware reference platform supports multiple WSNs on a single board (XRF, RFM12B, Z-Wave, EnOcean, and Xbee, plus ethernet and USB on the Pi)
