**][11]** &#8220;IPv6, is an Internet Layer protocol for packet-switched internetworking and provides end-to-end datagram transmission across multiple IP networks. It is described in Internet standard document RFC 2460, published in December 1998.[5] In addition to offering more addresses, IPv6 also implements features not present in IPv4. It simplifies aspects of address assignment (stateless address autoconfiguration), network renumbering and router announcements when changing network connectivity providers. It simplifies processing of packets by routers by placing the need for packet fragmentation into the end points. The IPv6 subnet size has been standardized by fixing the size of the host identifier portion of an address to 64 bits to facilitate an automatic mechanism for forming the host identifier from link-layer media addressing information (MAC address). Network security is also integrated into the design of the IPv6 architecture, including the option of IPsec.&#8221;

**[6LoWPAN][12]**
  
&#8220;6LoWPAN is a acronym of IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks. It is an adaption layer for IPv6 over IEEE802.15.4 links. This protocol operates only in the 2.4 GHz frequency range with 250 kbps transfer rate. There is no encryption defined by the 6LoWPAN protocol, the range isup to 200 meter and the maximum nodes is limited to 100per network. This limitation exists for one channel and can be extended using wired backbones to connect subnets.&#8221;

**[MQTT][13]** (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
  
&#8220;The MQTT protocol enables a publish/subscribe messaging model in an extremely lightweight way. It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.&#8221;

&#8211;[Mosquitto][14]: An Open Source MQTT v3.1 Broker

**[CoAP][15] **(Constrained Application Protocol)
  
&#8220;A specialized RESTful (Representational State Transfer) protocol for use with constrained networks and nodes for machine-to-machine applications such as smart energy and building automation.  COAP/UDP vs. HTTP/TCP&#8221;

&#8211; [SMCP ][16]— A C-based CoAP stack which is suitable for embedded environments. Features include:
  
Supports draft-ietf-core-coap-13, Fully asynchronous I/O, Supports both BSD sockets and UIP

**[ROLL][17]** (IPv6 routing for low power/lossy networks)

**[XMPP][18]** (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)
  
An open technology for real-time communication, which powers a wide range of applications including instant messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice and video calls, collaboration, lightweight middleware, content syndication, and generalized routing of XML data.

* * *

[LLAP ][19](lightweight local automation protocol)
  
&#8220;LLAP is a simple short message that is sent between inteligent objects using normal text, it&#8217;s not like TCP/IP, bluetooth, zigbee, 6lowpan, WiFi etc which achieve at a low level &#8220;how&#8221; to move data around. This means LLAP can run over any communication medium.
  
The three strengths of LLAP are, it&#8217;ll run on anything now, anything in the future and it&#8217;s easily understandable by humans.&#8221;

**[CCNx][20]**
  
CCNx® is an open source project in early stage development exploring the next step in networking, based on one fundamental architectural change: replacing named hosts with named content as the primary abstraction.

**<a href="http://www.ccnx.org/" target="_blank">Content-Centric Networking</a>** (CCN) &#8211; <a href="http://www.ccnx.org/releases/latest/doc/technical/CCNxProtocol.html" target="_blank">Technical Overview</a>
  
&#8220;Next-gen network architecture to solve challenges in content distribution scalability, mobility, and security.
  
CCN directly routes and delivers named pieces of content at the packet level of the network, enabling automatic and application-neutral caching in memory wherever it’s located in the network. The result? Efficient and effective delivery of content wherever and whenever it is needed.  Since the architecture enables these caching effects as an automatic side effect of packet delivery, memory can be used without building expensive application-level caching services.&#8221;

**<a href="http://www.cwc.oulu.fi/nanoip/" target="_blank">NanoIP</a>**
  
&#8220;NanoIP, which stands for the nano Internet Protocol, is a concept that was created to bring Internet-like networking services to embedded and sensor devices, without the overhead of TCP/IP. NanoIP was designed with minimal overheads, wireless networking, and local addressing in mind.&#8221;

<a href="http://portals.omg.org/dds/" target="_blank">Data-Distribution Service for Real-Time Systems</a> (DDS)
  
&#8220;Open international middleware standard directly addressing publish-subscribe communications for real-time and embedded systems.&#8221;

&#8220;The communication model aims at defining the main communication paradigms for connecting entities, as defined in the domain model. We provide a reference communication stack, together with insight about the main interactions among the actors in the domain model. We developed  a communication stack similar to the ISO OSI 7-layer model for networks, mapping the needed features of the domain model unto communication paradigms. We also describe how communication schemes can be applied to different types of networks in IoT.&#8221;

**][11]** &#8220;IPv6, is an Internet Layer protocol for packet-switched internetworking and provides end-to-end datagram transmission across multiple IP networks. It is described in Internet standard document RFC 2460, published in December 1998.[5] In addition to offering more addresses, IPv6 also implements features not present in IPv4. It simplifies aspects of address assignment (stateless address autoconfiguration), network renumbering and router announcements when changing network connectivity providers. It simplifies processing of packets by routers by placing the need for packet fragmentation into the end points. The IPv6 subnet size has been standardized by fixing the size of the host identifier portion of an address to 64 bits to facilitate an automatic mechanism for forming the host identifier from link-layer media addressing information (MAC address). Network security is also integrated into the design of the IPv6 architecture, including the option of IPsec.&#8221;

**[6LoWPAN][12]**
  
&#8220;6LoWPAN is a acronym of IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks. It is an adaption layer for IPv6 over IEEE802.15.4 links. This protocol operates only in the 2.4 GHz frequency range with 250 kbps transfer rate. There is no encryption defined by the 6LoWPAN protocol, the range isup to 200 meter and the maximum nodes is limited to 100per network. This limitation exists for one channel and can be extended using wired backbones to connect subnets.&#8221;

**[MQTT][13]** (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
  
&#8220;The MQTT protocol enables a publish/subscribe messaging model in an extremely lightweight way. It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.&#8221;

[LLAP ][19](lightweight local automation protocol)
  
&#8220;LLAP is a simple short message that is sent between inteligent objects using normal text, it&#8217;s not like TCP/IP, bluetooth, zigbee, 6lowpan, WiFi etc which achieve at a low level &#8220;how&#8221; to move data around. This means LLAP can run over any communication medium.
  
The three strengths of LLAP are, it&#8217;ll run on anything now, anything in the future and it&#8217;s easily understandable by humans.&#8221;

&#8220;Next-gen network architecture to solve challenges in content distribution scalability, mobility, and security.
  
CCN directly routes and delivers named pieces of content at the packet level of the network, enabling automatic and application-neutral caching in memory wherever it’s located in the network. The result? Efficient and effective delivery of content wherever and whenever it is needed.  Since the architecture enables these caching effects as an automatic side effect of packet delivery, memory can be used without building expensive application-level caching services.&#8221;

&#8220;The communication model aims at defining the main communication paradigms for connecting entities, as defined in the domain model. We provide a reference communication stack, together with insight about the main interactions among the actors in the domain model. We developed  a communication stack similar to the ISO OSI 7-layer model for networks, mapping the needed features of the domain model unto communication paradigms. We also describe how communication schemes can be applied to different types of networks in IoT.&#8221;

### Communications:

**][30] IEEE 802.15.4 is a standard which specifies the physical layer and media access control for low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs). It is maintained by the IEEE 802.15 working group. It is the basis for the ZigBee,ISA100.11a, WirelessHART, and MiWi specifications, each of which further extends the standard by developing the upper layers which are not defined in IEEE 802.15.4. Alternatively, it can be used with 6LoWPAN and standard Internet protocols to build a wireless embedded Internet.

**[NFC][31]**
  
Based on the standard ISO/IEC 18092:2004, using inductive coupled devices at a center frequency of13.56 MHz. The data rate is up to 424 kbps and the rangeis with a few meters short compared to the wireless sensornetworks.

**[ANT][32]**
  
ANT is a proprietary wireless sensor network technology featuring a wireless communications protocol stack that enables semiconductor radios operating in the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical allocation of the RF spectrum (&#8220;ISM band&#8221;) to communicate by establishing standard rules for co-existence, data representation, signalling, authentication and error detection.

**[Bluetooth][33]**
  
Bluetooth works in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and uses frequency hopping. With a data rate up to 3 Mbps and maximum range of 100m. Each application type which can use Bluetooth has its own profile.

**[ZigBee][34]**
  
The ZigBee protocol uses the 802.15.4 standard and operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency range with 250 kbps. The maximum number of nodes in the network is 1024 with a range up to 200 meter. ZigBee can use 128 bit AES encryption.

**[EnOcean][35]**
  
EnOcean is a an energy harvesting wireless technology which works in the frequencies of 868 MHz for europe and 315 MHz for North America. The transmit range goes up to 30 meter in buildings and up to 300 meter outdoor.

**[WiFi][36]**

[ETSI M2M][37]

**[Dash7][38]**
  
Based on the ISO 18000-7 Standard and uses a RF frequency of 433.92 MHz and a transfer rate up to 20kbps. The range can be adjusted from 100 to 10 kilometer with a dynamically adjustable datarate of 28 kbps to 200kbps. The ISO Standard is not available for free.

**[Weightless][39]**
  
Weightless is a proposed proprietary open wireless technology standard for exchanging data between a base station and thousands of machines around it (using wavelength radio transmissions in unoccupied TV transmission channels) with high levels of security.

**[WiMax][40]**
  
WiMax is based on the standard IEEE 802.16 and is intended for wireless metropolitan area networks. The range is different for fixed stations, where it can go up to 50 km and mobile devices with 5 to 15 km. WiMAx operates at frequencies between 2.5 GHz to 5.8 GHz with a transferrate of 40 Mbps.

    &#8220;A number of different standardization bodies and groups are actively working on creating more inter-operable protocol stacks and open standards for the Internet of Things. As we move from the HTTP, TCP, IP stack to the IOT specific protocol stack we are suddenly confronted with an acronym soup of protocols- from the wireless protocols like ZigBee, RFID, Bluetooth and BACnet tonext generation protocol standards such as 802.15.4e, 6LoWPAN, RPL, CoAP etc. which attempt to unify the wireless sensor networks and the established internet.&#8221;
