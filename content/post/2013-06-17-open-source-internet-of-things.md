The **Open Horizontal Platform** is a set of tools that enable vertical IoT platforms that can be combined together with a powerful new class of horizontally integrated applications and solutions. Consisting of a set of common abstractions, connectivity features, and new software components, the Open Horizontal Platform gives hardware manufactures and software developers the tools they need to create vertically integrated services that natively support broad horizontal interoperability across the Internet of Things ecosystem. The Open Horizontal Platform is a critical piece of infrastructure needed to turn the Internet of Things from a promise to reality.
