Adidas claims the SMART RUN can last for two weeks if you use it just as a watch which they call “casual mode”. This mode collects no health data at all so you basically have a really expensive watch. There are two other modes differentiated by the frequency of data collection. “Marathon” will give you data every 5 seconds and will last for 8 hours and “Training” gives you data every second but lasts only 4 hours, although that might be ok for a training session if you charge it afterwards. A full recharge takes about 4 hours.
