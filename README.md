# WHAT
i study the static blog tools of hugo, so i think i will use hugo for my new blog framework. 
the hugo can convert the markdown file to html, so i can use the github as a editor of the md file .

# HOW
first, you write the artical in the github.then you can use a scripte to download the md file from github and be used for hugo .
so the github will become your online blog editor.

it is fun!
